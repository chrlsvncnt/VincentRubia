        As a basketball coach, you have one of the most important and exciting jobs in the world! <br><br>
        
        Think about it.<br><br>

        Teachers would love to get the enthusiasm that you get from your players. Most kids are there because they want to be and because they have a passion for the sport.<br><br>

         Your players look up to you. And they might not always listen to you, they will remember certain things you tell them for the rest of their lives. <br>
         And you have the opportunity to make a POSITIVE impact on their lives.<br><br>

        Bottom line. You have a very important and rewarding job!<br><br>

        In this area of our website, you'll find a variety of coaching tactics, philosophies, and concepts that will help you become a better basketball coach.<br><br>

        So let's get to it!

        <h4>
            All beginner players should start with Level 1 no matter the age. We put ages next to the level as a general guideline. 
            Depending on the age and skill level, you'll progress through the levels at different rates. You may notice that you'll spend 4 years working on Level 1 with 7 to 10 year olds. 
            At the same time, you may be able to progress to Level 2 after two weeks working with a group of 13 year olds who are playing basketball for the first time. <br><br>

            I would advise to go back and start at Level 1 every year. A lot of high school and college coaches start at Level 1 every year. 
            They just progress through the levels more quickly than a youth team. 
            It's a great way to ingrain the fundamentals into your players year in and year out.

                    ay ups - You should practice lots of lay ups with both hands. Your goal should be to get 
                    all players to make lay ups with their left and right hands equally well!! Teach them to jump off the proper foot. 
                    They should jump off the left leg when shooting a right hand lay up. 
                    They should shoot off their right leg when shooting a left hand lay up. 
                    It will be difficult but work on it. 
                    You'll probably need to start really close to the basket, with no dribble, and take just one step to practice the footwork. 
                    Once you add the dribble, 
                    they should dribble with their left hand when shooting left hand lay ups. And vice versa.

                <br>

                <li>
                    Footwork - Teach them triple threat positioning, pivoting on their left and right foot without traveling, jump stops, 
                    and to square to the basket as soon as they catch the ball in a triple threat position. 
                    You should spend a lot of time on footwork!

                <li>
                    Shooting form - For this age group, we highly recommend using smaller balls and lower baskets. 
                    If that is not possible, allow the players to dip their elbows which will give them more strength. 
                    To learn more on shooting, we also have the Breakthrough Basketball Shooting Guide.

                <li>
                    Ball handling - You should teach your players to dribble with left and right hands equally. 
                    Basic dribble moves such as the speed dribble, crossover, protect-the-ball dribble, and back-up dribble.    
                </li>
 <br>
                <li>
                    Athletic & movement skills - Teach them how to run, jump and land, skip, stop, move laterally, squat, lunge and any other basic movements. 
                    If you don't know how to teach these movements, ask a professional or PE teacher to show you how. 
                    99% of the time they would be more than willing to help, and they may even come and show the kids themselves.
                </li>
<br>
                <li>
                    Basic passes - Teach and practice the basic chest, bounce, and overhead passes.
                </li>
<br>
                <li>
                    Play plenty of 2 on 2 and 3 on 3 games to teach concepts (no dribble keep away). 
                    It gets the players more experience and allows them enough space to operate and use the new skills they have learned. 
                    Make sure to use plenty of age-appropriate drills & games.

                    Offense - Do NOT use any structured or patterned offenses. 
                    First, get them comfortable on the court. They will start to figure things out on their own. 
                    Your main concern should be to have them move & not stand still. <br><br>
                    If you use a few basic cuts and maybe screens in your shooting drills at the beginning of practice, 
                    then your players will already know how to move in a motion offense. 
                    Then you don't have to waste time teaching offense. Just let them play.<br><br>

Once players        feel comfortable on the court, show them proper spacing.<br><br>

As they prog        ress, you can start to introduce them to motion offense situations.
                </li>
<br>                
                <li>
                    Basic cuts & how to get open - If time permits, you can introduce the basket cut and straight cut. 
                    I would suggest that you just work these cuts into your shooting drills at the beginning of practice. This will save loads of time.
                </li>
<br>
                <li>
                    Defense - Teach the basic stance, defensive slide, and basic off-ball principles. 
                    Don't worry about spending as much time on defense. 
                    As they get older, you'll gradually spend more time on defense. Focusing on it 5 to 10 minutes per practice would be more than sufficient.
